  p I created a&nbsp
    a(href='https://zhanwenchen-todo.herokuapp.com/') to-do list web app
    | .

  p This web app is based on Michael Herman's
    a(href='http://mherman.org/blog/2015/02/12/postgresql-and-nodejs/#.WHVE7rYrInU') tutorial
    | which implements a version of this app using Node.js, Express.js,
    | Angular.js, and PostgreSQL. I implemented the database on Heroku's
    | own PostgreSQL.

  p I wish to expand this project by adding features, including a login layer,
    | the ability to view and manage completed tasks, and functionalities
    | such as categorization, priority and urgency. Additionally, I also seek
    | to implement an iOS app that lets users work with this app.
